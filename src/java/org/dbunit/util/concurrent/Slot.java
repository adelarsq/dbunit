/**
 * A one-slot buffer, using semaphores to control access.
 * Slots are usually more efficient and controllable than using other
 * bounded buffers implementations with capacity of 1.
 * <p>
 * Among other applications, Slots can be convenient in token-passing
 * designs: Here. the Slot holds a some object serving as a token,
 * that can be obtained
 * and returned by various threads.
